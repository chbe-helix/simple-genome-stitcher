# Simple Genome Stitcher and Genome Coordinant Converter

Purpose: These programs are ment to enable conversion from one genome coordinant system to another in genomes from the same species (ex GRCH37 to GRCH38 in humans)

This is only a beta version built in python3 as a proof of concept. There are many optimizations that need to be made to the algorithms present.

Full version will be designed and built in another language with optimized operations.
